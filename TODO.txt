- Rename this project to something unique on the PyPI.

- SampleRate for ideal convertion of samples to time?

- t1 == ~t2 (via __invert__ which proxies approx(e=10**-6)) could be a standin for "approximately equal"

- Does this really need to be in Cython? Does the speed actually get us anything?

- If Cython, can these just be extensions of int/float, or do they really need
  to be external classes?
